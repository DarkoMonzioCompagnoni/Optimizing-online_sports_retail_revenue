# Optimizing online sports retail revenue using SQL
In this notebook, I played the role of a product analyst for an online sports clothing company. The company is specifically interested in how it can improve revenue. <be> I dove into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, and ratings, as well as revenue and website traffic, to produce recommendations for its marketing and sales teams.
